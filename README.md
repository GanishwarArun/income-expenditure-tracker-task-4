Hi Guys, 
I prepared the coding for  income-expenses calculator mini project by using HTML, CSS - tailwind CSS (minimal) and JAVA SCRIPT (JS), 
in JS i used DOM (Document object model) and local storage (JSON parse) it initializes the variable and stores the transaction in local storage otherwise an empty array is used .
as the code/project want to function i used many function like remove transaction function , update amount (balance, income and exp)
